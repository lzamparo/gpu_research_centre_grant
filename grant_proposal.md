# Accelerated learning of chromatin-centric gene regulation with GPUs

From JC's email:
```
* brief summary of current and planned research utilizing GPUs; a couple of paragraphs is fine
* a few relevant citations
* an illustrative figure

with special attention toward hitting the "vision, quality, and impact" criteria noted in the instructions below.
```

So, I need a few paragraphs re this proposal:


- what the relevant problems are

- what has been done with GPUs before

	- Basset, DeepBind, Deep SEA

- what we plan to do
	- more informative feature representations (a la SeqGL)
	- more modes of data rather than just sequence

- why we need GPUs
	- figure 6 from Basset paper

- citations: 
	- Deep Bind
	- Deep SEA
	- Basset (bioarxiv)
	- DanQ (bioarxiv)
